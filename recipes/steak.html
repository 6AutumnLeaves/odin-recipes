            <li>A cut of ribeye steak</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>

            <li>Salt and pepper to taste<li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Let the steak rest at room temperature for 30 minutes</li>
            <li>While this is going on, you can prepare the garlic and rosemary</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remove the skin from three cloves of garlic and then crush them. (just enough to be opened)</li>
                    <li>Take three stalks of rosemary</li>
                    <li>That's all! Not a ton you need to do there</li>
                </ul>
            <li>After 20 minutes, preheat a pan at medium high heat. Coat with olive oil
            <li>Season the steak, generously coating each side</li>
            <li>When pan is preheated, start cooking steak. Cook one side for around 2 minutes then flip.</li>
            <li>Cook other side for 1 minute, then add butter. When butter melts, add garlic and rosemary</li>
            <li>Cook for another minute or so</li>
            <li>Let rest after done cooking. This will let it soak in more juices</li>
